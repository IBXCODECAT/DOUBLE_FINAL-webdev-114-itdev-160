            <p>
                Welcome! We're thrilled to introduce you to Blue bot, a new addition to the world of Discord bots.
                Blue bot is a versatile and reliable moderation bot designed to help you manage your server more
                efficiently.
                What sets Blue bot apart from other bots is its commitment to privacy. Unlike many other moderation
                bots,
                Blue bot does not collect message data, which means you can trust it to keep your conversations private
                and secure.
                With Blue bot on your server, you can feel confident that your conversations will remain confidential
                while still enjoying
                all the benefits of a top-notch moderation bot. We hope you'll add Blue bot to your server today and see
                for yourself how it
                can transform your Discord experience.
